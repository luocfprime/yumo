# Install

Prerequisites: You must have at least one Python package manager installed (
e.g. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).

Install it from PyPI:

```bash
uv tool install yumo
```

Or, if you want to run it once without installing it, you can use the `uv run` command:

```bash
uv run --with yumo yumo xxx  # xxx being the subcommand you want to run
```
